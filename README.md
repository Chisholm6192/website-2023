## Setup

Fork this repo and then clone it onto your local machine.

```
git clone <your fork name>
cd website-2020
```

Set the original repo (ie non fork) as the "remote"

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thegoldenhack/website-2020.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
```

Set the environment variables and fill in the fields in the .env file with the appropriate values (if applicable).

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Check out a new branch and get started :)

```
git checkout -b <your branch name>
npm install
```

## Rebasing

Each time you open the codebase with the intention of doing some work on it, I recommend that you do a rebase. Trust me, it's MUCH better than merging, and as long as we work on distinct parts of the codebase, we shouldn't run into many issues.

Save your progress
`git stash save`

Get any changes that may have been made on master, and keep your forked branch in sync with the main repo

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git push origin master
```

Go back to the branch you were on
`git checkout <your branch name>`

Rebase master -> you may have some conflicts to deal with at this point, but just follow the instructions in the console and everything should be ok
`git rebase master`

## PR Process

So let's say you wrote some code and you are ready to get it peer reviewed.

The first time you do this you may be prompted for your GitHub username and password!

_First make sure you've rebased!!_

Add the files you want to commit either individually
ie `git add src/views/HomePage/index.js`
or add all the files that have been modified
ie `git add .`

Commit the files you changed
`git commit -am 'Helpful commit message'`

Push to the remote
`git push origin <your branch name>`

Then hit the link in the console to open a pull request.

Pull requests must be reviewed and approved by 1 other team mate, at which point I (Dunja) will review it as well. If everything looks good, I'll merge your code to master!

Pull in your changes, and open a new branch

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b <your new branch name/>
```
